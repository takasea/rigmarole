# Hina(Young Bird) : (Maybe) Simple Architecture Template

## Useage

1. [Creating a repository from a template](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)

2. `flutter create .`

3. fix README.md

4. Coding!

I think you'll fix the test first. If you really don't want to write tests, you might comment out all the tests, but I don't recommend it. Then, is the cognitive load high?

```
Rather than increasing the cognitive load and reducing redundancy, We want to reduce the cognitive load even if it means describing the same thing in a same way.
```
